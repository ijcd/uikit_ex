UIkit and reactive JavaScript frameworks

UIkit is listening for DOM manipulations and will automatically initialize, connect and disconnect components as they are inserted or removed from the DOM. That way it can easily be used with JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js and React.


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `uikit_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:uikit_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/uikit_ex](https://hexdocs.pm/uikit_ex).
